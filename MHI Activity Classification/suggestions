use median filtering for extracting the background

create a function to get hu moments from video portions

create a function to build the entire dataset with mus and vs and then store it in numpy array


Hve used 7 hu moments instead of 6
-use  blurring (5,5) sigma 0 and (3,3) for morphing when creating images for showing - DONE --> GENERATED MEI AND MHI for training ones
-otherwise use (13,13) and (9,9) with sigma 1




1. Build Dataset
2. Save it as numpy
3. Load from numpy
4. create KNN
5. train model
    -> Here I am just using scale invariant features - v
6. create features from test video
7. test model
8. create output video
9. create confusion matrix
"""

put it in chunks of 7 frames each
and get predictions for 7 - 7 frames at a time
for frame 1 - argmax of first 7

last 6 frames have the same as the 7th last frame
